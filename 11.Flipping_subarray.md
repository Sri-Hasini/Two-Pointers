# **Flipping Subarray**
You are given a binary array arr whose elements are only 0 and 1. Your task is to find the length of the longest subarray that contains only 1's after flipping exactly one contiguous subarray from 0 to 1.

## Input Format
- The first line contains one integer n, the size of the array. 
- Next line contains n integers arr[0],arr[1]...arr[n], representing the elements of the array.

## Output Format
- Find length of longest subarray with 1 after flipping one contiguous subarray.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
- 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤1

**Sample 1 :**
<table style="border:2px grey solid">
  <tr>
    <th style="border:2px grey solid">Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border:2px grey solid">
    <td rowspan = "2" style="border:2px grey solid">3 <br>0 1 0</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Explanation :**<br>
Flip the first contiguous 0 to make it 1, the arr would look like 1,1,0. it contains 2 ones that are maximum from all possible cases.

**Sample 2 :**
<table style="border:2px grey solid">
  <tr>
    <th style="border:2px grey solid">Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border:2px grey solid">
    <td rowspan = "2" style="border:2px grey solid">3 <br>0 0 0</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Explanation :**<br>Flip all the elements as it is contiguous , then the arr would look like 1,1,1 and it has a maximum number of ones that is 3.

## Approach : 
- First, we need to check whether there is atleast one zero or not, if not, then we need to print size - 1 (because at any case, we should flip atleast one element even if 0 is not present).
- If atleast one 0 is present, then we can enter the loop iterating from 0 to n - 1.
- If we found any 0, then we can perform calculations as below, orelse we can go to iterate next step.
    - Calculate the number of contiguous 0's block using another loop inside.
    - Then, if that starting point is not 0 and ending point is not n - 1, we can caculate the count of 1's towards left of this 0's block and count of 1's towards right of this 0's block.
    - Then add those 2 counts and also add the count of 0's block and then update maxi, if current sum is greater.

## Code in cpp :
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector <int> a(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> a[i];
    bool yes = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {//edge case of having all 1's
        if (a[i] == 0) {
            yes = false;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (yes) {
        cout << n - 1 << endl;//we can print size - 1 in that case
    }
    else {
        int j = 0, maxi = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] == 0) {
                j = i;
                while (j < n && a[j] == 0) {//computing the contiguous 0's block
                    j++;
                }
                int left = (i > 0) ? i - 1 : -1;
                int right = (j < n) ? j : n;
                int leftcount = 0, rightcount = 0;
                //calulating number of contiguous 1's towards left of this 0's block
                for (int k = left; k >= 0 && a[k] == 1; k--) {
                    leftcount++;
                }
                //calculating number of contiguous 1's towards right of this 0's block
                for (int k = right; k < n && a[k] == 1; k++) {
                    rightcount++;
                }
                int total = leftcount + rightcount + (j - i);
                maxi = max(maxi, total);
                i = j - 1;
            }
        }
        cout << maxi << endl;
    }
}
```
