# Your Name is Mine

## Question
In an attempt to control the rise in population, Archer was asked to come up with a plan. This time he is targeting marriages. Archer, being as intelligent as he is, came up with the following plan:

A man with name M is allowed to marry a woman with name W, only if M is a subsequence of W or W is a subsequence of M.

A is said to be a subsequence of B, if A can be obtained by deleting some elements of B without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Your task is to determine whether a couple is allowed to marry or not, according to Archer's rule.

## Input
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space separated strings M and W.

## Output
For each test case print "YES" if they are allowed to marry, else print "NO". (quotes are meant for clarity, please don't print them)

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ |M|, |W| ≤ 25000 (|A| denotes the length of the string A.)
- All names consist of lowercase English letters only.

## Example :
<table style="border:2px grey solid">
  <tr>
    <th style="border:2px grey solid">Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border:2px grey solid">
    <td style="border:2px grey solid">3<br>
    john johanna<br>
    ira ira<br>
    kayla jayla</td>
    <td>YES<br>YES<br>NO<br><br></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Explanation :
**Case 1:** Consider **S = "johanna".** So, **S[0] = 'j', S[1] = 'o', S[2] = 'h'** and so on. If we remove the indices [3, 4, 6] or [3, 5, 6] from S, it becomes **"john".** Hence **"john"** is a subsequence of S, so the answer is "YES".

**Case 2:** Any string is a subsequence of it self, as it is formed after removing **"0"** characters. Hence the answer is "YES".

**Case 3:** **"jayla"** can not be attained from **"kayla"** as removing any character from **"kayla"** would make the string length smaller than **"jayla"**, also there is no **'j'** in **"kayla"**. Similar reasoning can be applied to see why **"kayla"** can't be attained from **"jayla"**. Hence the answer is "NO".

## Approach
- We created 2 pointers i as the starting point of string m, and j as the starting point of string w.
- Then we compared both, if they are equal increment cnt, i, j by 1.
- Or else, if m's size is less than w's size, increment j value by 1, other increment i value by 1.
- finally check if cnt value equals minimum of sizes of m and w, if yes print YES otherwise print NO

## Code in cpp :
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        string m, w;
        cin >> m >> w;
        int i = 0, j = 0, cnt = 0;
        while (i < m.size() && j < w.size()) {
            if (m[i] == w[j]) {
                i++;
                j++;
                cnt++;
            }
            else {
                if (m.size() < w.size()) {
                    j++;
                }
                else {
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        if (cnt == min(m.size(), w.size())) cout << "YES\n";
        else cout << "NO\n";
    }
}
```
